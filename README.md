```

---

## 👥 For Contributors (Fork & PR)

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Visit the main repository  
   👉 [Kural Admin Repository](https://github.com/Dhavanesh24cs412/kural-admin)
2. Click **Fork** (top-right corner)
3. Your fork will be created at:  
   ```
   https://github.com/Dhavanesh24cs412/kural-admin.git
   ```

---

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhavanesh24cs412/kural-admin.git
cd kural-admin
```

---

### Step 3: Add Upstream Remote (Main Repository)

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Dhavanesh24cs412/kural-admin.git
git fetch upstream
```

Verify remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
```

---

### Step 4: Create a Feature Branch

> **Never work directly on `main`**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b your-name-branch
```

**Branch Naming Conventions:**

- `feature/` – new features
- `fix/` – bug fixes
- `docs/` – documentation
- `chore/` – maintenance tasks

> **Tip:** Use your name as part of the branch name to avoid branch clutter. Example: `yourname-branch`

---

### Step 5: Make Your Changes

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Make your changes, then stage and commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add responsive navbar"
```

---

### Step 6: Push Changes and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin yourname-branch
```

Then open a **Pull Request** on GitHub with a clear description of your changes.

---

## 🔍 For Admins (Review & Merge)

### Reviewing Pull Requests

1. Check out the PR branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
2. Admin Testing Workflow

```bash
# Get the latest data from the repository
git fetch origin
```
3. Check out the contributor's branch:

```bash
# Switch to their branch
git checkout <branch-name>

# Ensure it's up to date
git pull origin <branch-name>
```
4. Clean Install & Run:

```bash
# Install any new packages they might have added
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```
5. Verification Checklist:
   
   [ ] Does the app start without console errors?
   [ ] Does the specific feature/fix work as described in the PR?
   [ ] Does it work on different screen sizes (Responsive Check)?
   [ ] Did it break any existing features?

6. Merge via GitHub (Recommended):

   Once testing passes, return to the GitHub PR web interface and select "Squash and merge" to keep the main history clean.
   
7. Cleanup your local environment:

```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Update your local main with the new merge
git pull origin main

# Delete the local copy of their feature branch
git branch -d <branch-name>
```
